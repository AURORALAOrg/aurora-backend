The language barrier was particularly difficult to overcome, even though I had taken some lessons before arriving.

For the past week, it has been raining fish - small silver fish that appear to fall from the sky during otherwise normal rainstorms. Scientists believe this strange occurrence is the result of a waterspout, a type of tornado that forms over water, which might have sucked up fish from a nearby lake. When the waterspout loses energy, the fish fall back to the ground, sometimes kilometers away from their original habitat. Local residents have mixed reactions to this bizarre event. Some see it as a bad omen, while others have been collecting the fish for their dinner tables. The town's mayor has invited marine biologists to study the phenomenon, hoping to find a definitive explanation. Meanwhile, Millfield has seen a surge in tourism as people from neighboring areas come to witness the 'fish rain' for themselves.",

Last week, they announced a compromise solution: the library's facade would be preserved and incorporated into the new development, while a smaller, modern library would be housed inside.
